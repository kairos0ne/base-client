            <p>The way to get your head around personas, is to think of subsets within a target market. These subsets are defined by scenarios.</p>

        <p class="col-lg-6 col-md-6 col-sm-12"><img id="foundation" src="/static/persona_image.png" alt=""></img>For instance - If I have a core target market: Male 35-40, professional, seeking stability in their middle ages. That's a very bad example but serves our purpose. If my product is laser eye surgery. I may have one persona seeking treatment for aesthetic reasons (get rid of my glasses), another seeking treatment as he is an active sporty guy (cant play sport with glasses) and another, I can't drive without treatment (medical). All of these personas fit within the defined target audience, however will </p>
        <p class="col-lg-6 col-md-6 col-sm-12">interact with the brand in a completely different way. The the reason we build personas is to personalise the experience for each, thus increasing our chance of conversion. Understanding the way in which these personas interact online, is the foundation to providing continuity in interaction through business intelligence. This in turn, once agreed, is used to build the acquisition journeys by identifying the core consumer epics, and presenting the journeys respectively.</p>
